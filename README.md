# CryptoApp
Application to encode our string to see every algorithm with GUI in python

## Getting started
We'll have a full-python GUI where you'll put your string and it'll be encoded according to the algorithm that we chose  

## installing
[pending to complete the project...]

## Running CryptoApp
Running this app is so easy. You only need to be located at the Gui's folder and initiate the script wit the next command:
```bash
python index.py
```
We'll see a window with the button' matrix to choose any algorithm that we want and it'll show us the output encoded with the info
